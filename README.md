# Blog

## Basic blog site using Bootstrap template with MVC Framework
 
Home page displays the five most recent blog posts (only showing up to 200 characters). The title and Read More are links that take the user to a page that displays the full article. 
The individual blog post page displays the full contents of that blog post. The Comments section underneath contains a textbox for the commenter name, and a textarea for the contents of the comment. Javascript enables/disables the submit button until they enter a name and some text). Beneath that, display all the comments left for that article. When they submit a new comment, the page should refresh, and the comment should show up below. Also, using cookies, if a user has previously left a comment on the site, the name textbox will be prefilled with their name

Admin page has a form where the user can add new blog posts. When the new post is submitted, the user is redirected to that new individual blog page.

Includes pagination feature for user to advance to older/newer pages.
